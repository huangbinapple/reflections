When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local? 
  When I tranval around the word, but do not have a computer along with me, or when I
  work both at home and at company, useing different machine building the same project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  I can't find a reason, I think use automatical machaanisim if fine.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
  Fork is I make a copy of a repository on github and host it on my own github accout.
  Clone is I make a copy of a repository on github or my local machine to my local machine.
  Brach is a particular commit in a repository.
  I use fork when I surf the github and found some one else's repository and feel interested
  about it and want to make some modification.
  U use clone when I want to store a repository on github locally on my computer. 
  I make a branch when I make a change in one of my repository and want to keep track of it.
